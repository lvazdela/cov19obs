--------------------------------------------------------
Type of study:  Dichotomous
Requested output:  Sample size
        How is the alternative hypothesis expressed? Two proportions
        Matched or Independent? Independent
        Case control? Prospective
        Uncorrected chi-square or Fisher's exact test? Uncorrected chi-square test
        alpha=0.05 power=0.8 P0=0.15 P1=0.05 M=1
        Case sample size for uncorrected chi-squared test=140

We are planning a study with 1 control per experimental subject, an accrual interval of 60 time units, and additional follow-up after the accrual interval of 30 time units.  In a previous study the median survival time on the control treatment was 383.8 time units.  If the true hazard ratio (relative risk) of control subjects relative to experimental subjects is 3.16, we will need to study 234 experimental subjects and 234 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control survival curves are equal with probability (power) .800.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.
